Surgery for esophageal cancer is usually considered for localized or locally advanced disease after careful staging with endoscopy, biopsy, EUS, and cross-sectional imaging. Many patients benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to shrink the tumor, improve margin negativity, and increase cure rates. Esophagectomy (removal of the diseased esophagus segment) with reconstruction using stomach or colon aims for complete clearance and regional lymph node dissection. Minimally invasive or robotic techniques can reduce blood loss and speed recovery when anatomy and stage permit. Perioperative care targets optimal nutrition (often via feeding jejunostomy), pulmonary physiotherapy, pain control, and early mobilization. Patients are counselled on common risks—leak, pneumonia, vocal cord issues, reflux—and how the team mitigates them with meticulous technique, enhanced recovery protocols, and vigilant postoperative monitoring. Pathology guides adjuvant therapy and follow-up intervals. Long-term, diet advances from liquids to soft foods, with attention to portion size and reflux prevention. Regular surveillance checks for recurrence and addresses swallowing or nutritional concerns. A well-orchestrated plan—prehab, precise surgery, and structured rehab—helps patients regain strength, independence, and confidence.
